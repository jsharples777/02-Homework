# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Your Task

This repository contains the files needed to complete the first Homework Assignment **01 Code Reactoring** by taking an existing website outline and achieving the following Acceptance Criteria (see below), with appropriate code refactoring for ease of development and maintenance.

To achieve this:
1.  The HTML was reviewed and deemed to be well structured and with an appropriate header hierarchy;
2.  The broken link in the navigation bar was corrected to go to the appropriate sub-section of the page;
3.  Images were given alt tags matching their sections;
4.  The CSS was substantially refactored to reduce the number of classes doing the same thing, and reorganised to make the long term maintenance simpler.


## User Story
